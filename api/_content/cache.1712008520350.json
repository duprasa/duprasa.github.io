In other words, “Use it or lose it!” In my case it resulted in bad posture and a sore back.

Don’t re-read it, just write it and don’t show it to anyone. He continued by suggesting to end on a positive note. Something I interpreted often as “you got this” or “well done”. It was always a chore to start writing these. Ast first It was difficult, almost agony. I felt my body and mind strain to contort itself into this journaling mindset.

How did I not notice this before! Simply stopping and taking a moment to feel my body uncovered many things! Apparently this was called mindfulness!

I  started to follow this structure in my day to day life. Eventually I was able to identify what I was feeling, I may have even shown a small smirk with pride.
